# fitnesstimer

My experiment with Java ME. I needed some timer for counting rounds and rests for my [High-intensity interval training](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training).

WARNING: Don't judge my coding ability based on this project. Most of it is generated by Netbeans and it's more proof of concept then code which I would consider in production quality.
